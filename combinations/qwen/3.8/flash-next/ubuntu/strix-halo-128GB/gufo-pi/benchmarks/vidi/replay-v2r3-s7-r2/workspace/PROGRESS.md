Statuses: todo, doing, done, blocked (blocked = cannot be done on this machine; say why in NOTES.md).

Note on task 15: TC-32 also has firefox and webkit coverage through the opt-in
`marquee-firefox` / `marquee-webkit` Playwright projects
(`PLAYWRIGHT_CROSS_BROWSER=1 npx playwright test marquee-selection`). Those
browsers cannot start on this host — the system libraries are missing, see
NOTES.md story 1 note 12 — so the assertion is proven here in chromium.
