## Per story

New work is the story's own held-out tests. Regressions are earlier stories' held-out tests that passed before this story and fail after it; repairs the reverse. Cumulative is every held-out test for the stories built so far ([evaluation policy](../../../../../../../../../../benchmarks/spec-bench/EVALUATION-POLICY.md)). Cumulative can grow by more than the new work: some earlier tests need a later story's feature and are skipped until it exists.

| Story | New work | Regressions | Repairs | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 6/6 | 0 | 0 | 6/6 |
| 2 | 9/10 | 0 | 0 | 19/20 |

**New work** 15/16, **regressions** 0, **repairs** 0, **cumulative** 19/20.

## How it happened

Each story's commits, and which story broke or fixed an earlier story's held-out tests. Attribution is per commit, so an agent that commits once per story is blamed per story.

| Story | Commits | + / − lines | Most-changed source files (lines; tests and lockfiles left out) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 by the agent | 6648 / 0 | `BoardViewport.tsx` (238), `useCamera.ts` (122), `camera.ts` (111), `ZoomControls.tsx` (97), `App.tsx` (56), `playwright.config.ts` (35), +13 more |
| 2 | 1 by the agent | 2067 / 7 | `StickyNote.tsx` (241), `board-model.ts` (139), `StickyTextEditor.tsx` (126), `App.tsx` (124), `StickyText.ts` (76), `NoteToolbar.tsx` (69), +7 more |

### Earlier stories broken or fixed

No story changed an earlier story's held-out results.

### Interruptions and dead time

A gap in a story's agent events with a restart or a logged intervention inside it is dead time (the machine or the run was down), not agent time. *Active* is the story's event span minus that dead time, across every attempt. *Recorded* is the harness's agent time, which covers only the attempt after the last restart.

No interruptions inside a story.
