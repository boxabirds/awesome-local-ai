# Implementation notes

Decisions made while implementing without anyone to ask.

## Story 1 — Pan and zoom around an infinite board

- **Where `useCamera` lives.** The design's `BoardViewport(props: { children })` contract has no camera props,
  yet the camera needs the viewport's measured size. `BoardViewport` therefore owns `useCamera` and renders
  `ZoomControls` and `NavigationHint` as overlay siblings of the input surface; `App.tsx` just mounts
  `<BoardViewport />`. Because the controls are siblings (not children) of the wheel-listening surface, a
  Ctrl-wheel over them never reaches the board and the browser default is not suppressed there (TC-30).
- **`useCamera` extras.** Besides the contract members it exposes `isPanning` (drives the grab/grabbing cursor
  and `data-state="idle|panning"`) and `zoomAt(point, factor)` (used by the Safari gesture handler).
- **Keyboard shortcuts** are handled on `window` (the whole page is the board) but ignored while typing in
  inputs/textareas/contenteditable, so later text-editing stories are unaffected. `+`/`_` and numpad keys are
  accepted as aliases of `=`/`-`.
- **Grid dots** are a CSS radial-gradient centred in each tile, so the background position is shifted by half a
  tile to keep dots on world multiples of `GRID_SPACING_WORLD`.
- **Initial view** is `resetCamera(viewport)` (100%, origin centred). Window resizes change only the viewport
  size; the camera's top-left anchor is unchanged.
- **Test hook.** `window.__vidi6.{setCamera,getCamera}` is installed only when `import.meta.env.MODE === 'test'`
  (verified absent from the production bundle). `npm run build` is the production build; e2e runs
  `npm run build:test` (same `dist/client` directory) and serves it with `wrangler dev`.
- **Red-phase commit skipped.** Task 1 asks for a separate commit of failing tests; the session rules ask for a
  single story commit, so the unit tests and implementation land together.
- **Firefox e2e.** In the build environment Firefox cannot start (`sandbox_init() failed: Operation not
  permitted`; `newPage` times out). Chromium and WebKit pass. `E2E_BROWSERS=chromium,webkit npm run test:e2e`
  selects a subset; the default still runs all three browsers.
